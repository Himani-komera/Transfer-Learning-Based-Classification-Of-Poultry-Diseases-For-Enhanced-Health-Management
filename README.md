1. Introduction
 
Poultry farming is a significant source of food and income globally. However, disease outbreaks can cause major economic losses and pose serious health risks. Early and accurate diagnosis of poultry diseases is crucial for mitigating these impacts. This project leverages transfer learning, a powerful deep learning technique, to classify common poultry diseases based on images. The goal is to provide an efficient and accurate diagnostic tool that aids poultry farmers and veterinarians in improving animal health management.

2. Project Overview
   
This project utilizes a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, such as ResNet50, MobileNetV2, or EfficientNet, fine-tuned on a poultry disease image dataset. The system is designed to:

Classify images of chickens showing symptoms of various diseases.

Provide a user-friendly API interface for model inference.

Enable integration into farm management software or mobile applications.

Key features:

Transfer learning for improved accuracy and reduced training time.

RESTful API for model inference.

Basic frontend interface (optional).

3. Architecture
   
System Components: 
  [Dataset] --> [Preprocessing] --> [Transfer Learning Model] --> [Prediction/API] --> [Frontend/UI or JSON Output]
Architecture Details:

Input: Image of a chicken.

Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and augment the image.

Model: Fine-tuned CNN using transfer learning (e.g., ResNet50).

Output: Predicted class (e.g., Coccidiosis, Newcastle disease, etc.).

Interface: REST API built with FastAPI or Flask.

6. Running the Application
   
Train the model (optional, skip if using pre-trained model)


python src/train.py
Start the API server


cd api
uvicorn app:app --reload
Make predictions
Use tools like Postman or cURL:


curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/ -F image=@sample.jpg

7. API Documentation

The API is built using FastAPI, so it automatically generates docs.

Swagger UI:

Endpoints:

GET /: Welcome message or status.

POST /predict/: Accepts an image file and returns the predicted disease class.

Sample Request:


curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/" -F "image=@test.jpg"
Sample Response:
